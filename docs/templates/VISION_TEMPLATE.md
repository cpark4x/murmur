## 2. Strategic Positioning

### The Core Insight

**[What is everyone else doing?]**

[List key competitors and their approach]

**[Why are they wrong or incomplete?]**

[Explain the flaw in the common approach]

- **[Your approach]**: [What you do instead]

[Product name] is built for [your focus], not [their focus].

### What We're NOT Building

Clear boundaries help AI make correct decisions:

- ❌ [Competitor type 1] (we're [your differentiation])
- ❌ [Competitor type 2] (we're [your differentiation])
- ❌ [Feature category] (not competing on that axis)
- ❌ [Approach] (we're [your approach] instead)

## Writing Guidelines

**Purpose of Vision Document:**
- Define the problems in the world that need solving
- Articulate strategic positioning (how you're different)
- Identify target audience and why they're underserved
- Explain sequencing and phase strategy
- Provide decision-making context for AI (80% of purpose)

**WHAT to include:**
- User problems (real pain points)
- Strategic differentiation (your unique positioning)
- Target audience (who you're building for)
- Sequencing rationale (why this order)
- Clear boundaries (what you're NOT building)

**WHAT to exclude:**
- Implementation details (those go in principles)
- Feature specifications (those go in epics)
- Success metrics (separate doc: 04-SUCCESS-METRICS.md)
- Competitive details (separate doc: 03-COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md)
- Technical architecture (goes in dev-design/)

**For AI context (80%):**
- Make it decision-enabling (helps AI choose correctly)
- Provide clear boundaries (prevents building wrong things)
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Keep scannable with clear section headers

**For human readers (20%):**
- Executive summary at top
- Logical flow (problems → positioning → audience → sequence)
- Readable without technical background

**Test:** Can AI use this to make correct product decisions? Can a non-technical person understand the strategic direction?
